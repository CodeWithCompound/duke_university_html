        Revisiting some Web Development Concepts in the course at Duke
        University that eventually teaches java. for now i'm just going to have
        some fun with HTML & CSS, likely JS later as well

        Something cool i learned is that a hexadecimal color is pretty easy to
        understand <br />
        the first 2 numbers are for red, the next 2 for green, and the last 2
        for blue.
        <br />
        which means they can be easily represented with rgb!
